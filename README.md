# Game Idea
Tile game  
  
Win Condition = collect all the objectives  
Losing Condition = 0 stats or death square  
  
2 stats Confidence & Computer integrity  
the map or board represents the internet  
the map or board is made up of tiles  
5ish objectives randomly spawn and must be collected  
some tiles give buffs some affect stats  
bullying tiles lower confidence stat  
cat tiles increase confience stat  
virus's lower computer integrity stat  
software updates increase computer integrity stat  
A worm that moves around the board  
  
#Introduction (Lewis)
  (More to come)
  The aim for this project is to ‘Create a game that generates awareness about cyber security and cyber-crime’. This aim is an appropriate direction to challenge the provided brief because there are now over 2 billion people that have access to the internet across over 5 billion devices (Office of Cyber Security, 2011, p.11.) such as; PC's, tablets, smart phones and even televisions.
Within this connected digital age that we now live in comes a new type of criminal that pose a variety of threats. These criminals make use of sophisticated computer viruses which can steal personal information like bank and credit card details from a person’s computer, or something as simple as bullying across social networking sites. This can be a worry for every person that uses the internet, from government organisations to children who like to play online games.
And yet with all this threat that comes from online criminals there is still a severe lack of online security and awareness like in users aged 15 -24 70% were less likely to use internet security on all devices (McGuire, M. Et al. (2013) Cybercrime: A review of the evidence, p.25). This evidence shows that on a large amount of devices that access the internet don’t have sufficient protection this information tied with “Less than one-half (43%) of internet security software users sought advice about different products.”(McGuire 2013) shows that people are not educated enough in regards to software that can protect them.

Risk\\Likelihood of occurrence\\Impact on the project \\Mitigation
	
1 - One or more of the team’s member become ill / are unable to complete the work. \\ 	Low \\ High \\ Missing team members work shared between remaining members 

2 – One or more members fails to complete their work \\	Low \\	High\\	Work is completed by the rest of the team together

3 – Work is lost or corrupted \\ Low \\	High \\	Create backups of work on-line as well as on PCs

4 – Backup is lost due to loss of computer access or memory stick. \\  Low	\\ Low \\ Create on-line backups

5 - Loss of computer access \\	Low \\	Medium	\\ Find locations that could be used to gain back computer access 

6 – Lack of communication between team \\	Medium \\	Medium \\	Have regular meetings and exchange emails

7 – Team member has limited knowledge on software used \\ 	Medium \\	Medium \\	Work together to cover peoples weakness / set work based on skills

8 – Low motivation \\	Medium \\	Medium \\	Keep contact with member and have regular meeting to keep goals clear

9 – Software wanted / needed isn’t available \\	Low	\\ High \\	Have alternative programs available 

10 – Missing member \\	Low \\	High \\	Attempt to contact them if fails carry on as if they were not part of the team 

11 - Changing of the idea \\ Low \\ High \\ As soon as work starts do not change the main points of the project

13 - Conflicts happen between team members, to the point where refuse to work with each other \\ low \\ High \\ Form connections via a middle man, to allow work to continue

14- Conflicts between team members, arguments. \\ medium \\ Medium \\ Make the decision as a team by using a voting system. 

15 - Changing the objectives \\ medium \\ medium \\ Weight up the extra time need compared to the gains added to the project.
