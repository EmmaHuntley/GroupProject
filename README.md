# Ideas
Jack Browne: 

Lewis Catley: Although this idea is very short, when I first heard of the brief I was thinking of ossibly an educational game to make children aware of what cyber crime is and how it can affect them, although im not to sure how to turn this into a game that would be much fun...

Daniel Draper: A tower defence game where the player must stop waves of viruses / hacking attempts. Upgrades - show ways to reduce the risk e.g. stronger password - more set up time, better fire wall etc.

Adam James:

Liam Mason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNfE2um25xk When i think of cyber based game i kind of get the image of this game. The theme was cyber security and cyber crime i first thought this was just hacking but its also stuff like bullying over the internet so we could so some sort of shooter like this but the enemies could be different forms of cyber crime ie A bully sending a fb message, so if you look at that you tube video could be some sort of weird data enemy thing, can think of more but that's just a quick idea.

Emma Huntley: My idea is to theme another group members game on stuxnet or make a game a whole new game about it (will update more after a book gets delevered or more ideas come on this page)
