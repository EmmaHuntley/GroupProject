# Game Idea
Tile game  
  
Win Condition = collect all the objectives  
Losing Condition = 0 stats or death square  
  
2 stats Confidence & Computer integrity  
the map or board represents the internet  
the map or board is made up of tiles  
5ish objectives randomly spawn and must be collected  
some tiles give buffs some affect stats  
bullying tiles lower confidence stat  
cat tiles increase confience stat  
virus's lower computer integrity stat  
software updates increase computer integrity stat  
A worm that moves around the board
