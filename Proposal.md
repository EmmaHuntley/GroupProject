# Game Idea
Tile game  
  
Win Condition = collect all the objectives  
Losing Condition = 0 stats or death square  
  
2 stats Confidence & Computer integrity  
the map or board represents the internet  
the map or board is made up of tiles  
5ish objectives randomly spawn and must be collected  
some tiles give buffs some affect stats  
bullying tiles lower confidence stat  
cat tiles increase confience stat  
virus's lower computer integrity stat  
software updates increase computer integrity stat  
A worm that moves around the board  
  
#Introduction (Lewis)
The aim for this project is to ‘Create a game that generates awareness about cyber security and cyber-crime’. This aim is an appropriate direction to challenge the provided brief because there are now over 2 billion people that have access to the internet across over 5 billion devices (Office of Cyber Security, 2011, p.11.) such as; PC's, tablets, smart phones and even televisions.

Within this connected digital age that we now live in comes a new type of criminal that pose a variety of threats. These criminals make use of sophisticated computer viruses which can steal personal information like bank and credit card details from a person’s computer, or something as simple as bullying across social networking sites. This can be a worry for every person that uses the internet, from government organisations to children who like to play online games.

And yet with all this threat that comes from online criminals there is still a severe lack of online security and awareness like in users aged 15 -24 70% were less likely to use internet security on all devices (McGuire, M. Et al. (2013) Cybercrime: A review of the evidence, p.25). This evidence shows that on a large amount of devices that access the internet don’t have sufficient protection this information tied with “Less than one-half (43%) of internet security software users sought advice about different products.”(McGuire 2013) shows that people are not educated enough in regards to software that can protect them.

With creating a game this provides a new opportunity to inform people about the new age they live in and in regards to protecting themselves, granted this could be done in a variety of ways just a simple pamphlet but with the above statistic that just under a half sought advice on different products, so this could imply that people are too scared to seek help so games can inform players without scaring them, so giving them information without the players fully knowing that they are being taught new things. A game can also demonstrate in a fun environment the impact that real situations can have and the implications of these situations, but then show how to counter these with power-ups/buffs this then shows the user how to prevent these situations from happening to them in real life.

#Aims and objectives (Adam)
Our aim is to Create a game that generates awareness about cyber security and cyber-crime

The objectives to help us reach this aim are as follows: 
-Research types of cyber crime and cyber security risks andreal events of cyber crime, and include real issues
-Decide on game idea, a platform to put that game on, and which engine or tool kit to make it in.
-Draw concept art and designs for levels
-Choose sound assets
-Design levels and UI and Menus
-Code AI, script, event handling, and Ui
-Test game and Produce report
  
    
#Related Work (Emma)  
  
Making a game based on cyber security and cybercrime that would generate awareness is important. This section includes the details about cyber security and cybercrimes that have happened. Including real events in the game will help bring to like the reality of the game scenario.   
Other games have been made to raise awareness about dangers and have been rather successful, such as the mobile app Dumb ways to die (Frost and Baird, 2012) which was a public service campaign by Metro Trains. Metro’s manager of corporate relations, Leah Waymark detailed the campaigns success in an interview, stating that “For November to January 2011/12 there were 13.29 near-misses per million kilometres travelled by Metro trains on Melbourne's suburban train network. For November to January 2012/13 – after the campaign started – there were 9.17 near-misses per million kilometres.”(Cauchi, 2013).  
Some games have previously been based on the theme of “Cyber security” that can be looked at. An example would be Uplink (Introversion Software, 2001) a video game released in 2001 by British developers Introversion Software. The game although not graphically heavy allowed the player to take the role of a freelance hacker that was tasked with crashing corporate markets, stealing money from bank accounts and taking down global networks for clients with the ultimate goal of accumulating the most amount of money possible. Although this game didn’t utilise high end graphics it worked well as a menu/ window based approach helped the player to emerge more with the characters role. The hacking in game itself was based more around mini puzzles built in to represent breaking into systems.  
Another game worth noting is the 2014 game Watch Dogs (Ubisoft Montreal, 2014) released by Ubisoft. In this game the user takes on the role of a grey hat hacker named Aiden Pearce. Aiden as a hacker has access to the cities operating system “ctOS” (CenTral Operating System) that controls all of the cities electronics from ATMs to traffic light signals and even mobile phones. Using Aiden’s mobile phone as his primary tool, the player can hack into pretty much all of the cities systems along with the mobile phones of passing NPCs to steal money or even MP3s. In parts of this game Aiden deals with a collective of hackers who call themselves “DedSec” this could be reference to the hacking group “LulzSec” who have been behind the attacks of various corporate companies and websites which include, Nintendo, Bethesda Game Studios and even attacked the CIAs public website. This game was graphically very pretty as it was designed to be a 3rd person stealth type game.  
Finally in 1984 A.V.S developed System 15000 (A.V.S, 1984) for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Some may argue that this game was a pioneer in its genre of hacking simulation. Using a very simple design the user takes the role of system engineer who gets tasked with retrieving $1.5 million that was digitally stolen. Using a very basic number system and next to no graphics the player must decode and progress though solving puzzles based on telephone numbers and passwords, ultimately retrieving the money back once stolen. Rather than instantaneously giving the user the power to hack the user must logically use tactics and solve puzzles, which is arguably how real hacking and system intrusion works.  
These three games detail the theme of cyber security however they all take place from the “hackers” point of view. The aim of the project is to raise awareness hackers are already aware of the danger because in most instances they are the danger. There is a gap in this market for a game from the average internet user’s point of view. This gap is something that will be addressed through this project. For this to be done effectively real crimes or real dangers need to be incorporated into the game. Not in the sense that the user playing the game will be hacked or be in real danger but it must demonstrate what could happen in this scenario.   
Game mechanics and dynamics can be based of real viruses and threats. To get an idea of these mechanics it is important to know what these threats are.  
Computer security has no governing body thus there are no professional standards however Andress and Winterfeld (2011, 33) give some easy and simple definitions:  
-	“Event: Any recorded/ logged activity (no logging = no events)   
-	Incident: any event we investigate (some turn out to be nothing = false positive)  
-	Intrusion: any compromise of a system (ranging from a varies to a person breaking into a system – most organisations break out 5-10 categories of intrusion, based on the severity of the compromise)  
-	Virus: malicious code that required interaction to spread/ execute (i.e., open a PowerPoint that has script embedded that installs a program to compromise the system)  
-	Worm: malicious code that spreads/ executes on its own (executes a vulnerability then compromises the system and uses the system to attack other systems)  
-	Trojan horse: malicious code that masquerades as legitimate code (virus that is named a legitimate operating system file)
-	Backdoor: code or configurations that allow access in the future (keep a port open and listening to allow the hacker to connect anytime they want)  
-	Rootkit: malware that compromises the brain of the operating system (called the kernel) so our system tells us what the malware wants us to see rather than what is really happening (lying about what files , processes, or programs are really running)  
-	Phishing: efforts to steal our identity or access credentials (usually via email)  
-	Pharming: efforts to steal; mass groups worth of identity (Usually compromise the database with all the financial information)  
-	Spear Phishing: effort to steal a specific VIP’s identity (target a general officer or a chief level executive in a company)  
-	Zombies: systems on a network that are controlled by a hacker.  
-	Botnets: group of networked systems controlled by hacker.  
-	Honeynet/ Honeypot: system whose sole purpose is to be compromised (allows security professionals chance to analyse the malware)”

Methods

Unity- This will be our main development tool in creating the game. Most of the game will be done in unity apart form a through assets.

Maya/ 3DS max- These will be used if needed to make the model assets for the game.

Audacity- This will be used to edit and audio we wish to implement into the game.

Photoshop / Adobe- This may be needed for touch ups or edits of some assets.

Microsfot word- This will be used to write the report in.

Microsoft powerpoint- This will be used to make a presentation.

Sony Vegas- This may be needed if we need to edit game play footage.

Fraps- This will be used if we need to record the game play.

Facebook- This will be used for communication between group members as all of us have the Facebook messenger app , this is useful for getting into contact quickly.

Github- This is where we will store all the files needed for the project.


(not sure how much detail was needed, that all the software i can think off too)
